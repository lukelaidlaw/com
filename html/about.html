                        <p>When I was 3, I would have never dreamed of being here today. I was born with a cleft palate in the peopleâ€™s 
                            republic of China and lived in an orphanage for 3 years.</p>
                        <p>I never knew my birth-parents, 
                            however I do know that they were very compassioante and loved me.
                            See, when a child is born with a maxillo-facial disorder, they must undergo surgery or have a special bottle 
                            in order to survive. They did not have that special bottle nor have the money for surgery. So, they left me on the 
                            porch of an Orphange with a note stating in Chinese, "I hope a warm loving person will be able to raise my son, 
                            from a mother who desperatley wanted to, but isn't able to".</p>
                        <p>From the age of three, I grew a relationship with my care-taker and later known as my mother, "min". But, for reasons I couldn't understand then,
                            I was taken away and adopted at the age of 3.</p>
                        <p>Even though, my life is so much better now, my sub-conscious still feels the pain of detachment. Adoption is amazing, however many don't understand
                            that as you take in the "greater good", you also take in some bad emotions. I've had many trials throughout my life that many don't understand, such as having a
                            cleft palate, feelings of abandonment, and trials of faith. But these do not compare up to the unfathomable feelings of charity that I received from my community
                            family, and especially through my Heavenly Father. Because of this love, I was able to break through things I could not think of possibly overcoming.</p>
